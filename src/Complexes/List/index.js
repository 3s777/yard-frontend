            New York City designed by Japanese master architect Tadao Ando.
            Located at the corner of Kenmare and Elizabeth Streets in Nolita,
            the 32,000-square-foot building will stand as a profound
            architectural statement and embrace the industrial character of the
            neighborhood.
